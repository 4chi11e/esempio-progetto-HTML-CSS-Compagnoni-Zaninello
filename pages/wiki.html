                        <p>Destiny 2 è un videogioco sparatutto sviluppato da Bungie.
                            Rispetto al primo capitolo sono presenti nuove aree da esplorare, tra le quali possiamo trovare: la luna di Saturno, 
                            Titano, la luna di Giove, Io, il pianeta fittizio Nessus e la Zona Morta Europea sulla Terra (mappa che ritroviamo 
                            anche nel primo capitolo, anche se si presentava solamente giocabile in PvP). All'interno della Zona Morta Europea 
                            vi è anche una nuova area social, chiamata Il Rifugio.</p>
                            <p>Successivamente sono state pubblicate due espansioni: la prima intitolata La maledizione di Osiride, contenente una
                            nuova mappa ambientata sul pianeta Mercurio, mentre nella seconda, La Mente Bellica, vedremo una nuova ambientazione 
                            sul pianeta Marte.
                            Nella terza espansione, I Rinnegati, è stata introdotta la Riva Contorta e la Città Sognante.
                            La terza espansione, Ombre dal Profondo, segna il ritorno della Luna e l'aggiunta di una nuova area di gioco.</p>

                            <h3 class="med-text">Crogiolo</h3>
                            <p>Crogiolo, Assalti e Azzardo sono parte del nucleo centrale di Destiny al di fuori delle missioni di storia 
                                principale.
                                Il Crogiolo è la serie di partite PvP di Destiny ed è suddivisa in varie modalità appartenenti alla Classifica 
                                Valorosa o a quella Gloriosa.
                                Guadagnando punti e aumentando i propri Gradi Valorosi e Gloriosi è possibile sbloccare potenti armi definite 
                                Armi di punta. Al normale Crogiolo si aggiunge anche lo Stendardo di Ferro; mentre nel Crogiolo il livello di 
                                Potere non è contato e importano solo le build create personalmente dai giocatori, nello Stendardo di Ferro è 
                                diverso e il Potere viene contato.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="med-text">Assalti</h3>
                            <p>Gli Assalti sono missioni PvE che rappresentano operazioni organizzate dall’Avanguardia e affidate ai Guardiani. 
                                Sono spesso legati alla risoluzione di problemi in giro per il sistema solare ed è possibile selezionare 
                                manualmente quale giocare oppure far partire la Playlist Assalti per giocarne uno dopo l’altro senza un ordine 
                                preciso.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="med-text">Azzardo</h3>
                            <p>Azzardo, infine, è una modalità PvPvE. Sì, probabilmente non tutti conoscono questo termine apparentemente fuori 
                                dal mondo, ma è presto spiegato. In Azzardo, due squadre da quattro giocatori devono sconfiggere dei nemici e ogni 
                                squadra è posizionata in una mappa PvE separata. Ogni nemico, quando ucciso, lascia cadere una quantità di 
                                particelle fissa in base alla sua potenza. I giocatori devono raccogliere queste particelle e depositarle 
                                all’interno di una banca al centro della mappa. La prima squadra che raggiunge 75 particelle depositate fa 
                                spawnare un boss Primordiale che, se sconfitto, fa vincere il round. Il primo che vince due round su tre vince 
                                l’intera partita e, nel caso in cui si verifichi un 1 a 1, il terzo round partirà già con i boss su entrambi i 
                                campi saltando la fase di raccolta delle particelle.</p>

                            While individual Vex units are robotic in appearance, they are merely walking tools for
                            radiolaria, microscopic organisms suspended in Vex milk that contains the species'
                            collective intelligence. The Vex are capable of great feats of engineering such as
                            reconstructing entire planets like Mercury and Nessus into their Machine Worlds,
                            portal-based space travel, data processing and timeline manipulation on a scale impossible
                            for humanity, but lack language, thought and sentience in the human sense of those words.
                            They cannot be conciliated or reasoned with, and are hostile to every other lifeform but
                            their own.

                            The Vex have been present in the Solar System for billions of years, predating humanity;
                            their sophisticated and watchfully guarded structures can be found on multiple planets,
                            including Venus, Mars and Io. Some Vex locations, such as the Black Garden or the Vault of
                            Glass, are artificial realms existing outside of normal space and time.</p>

                        <p class="small-text">The Vex have been described as a "hyperintelligent time-spanning
                            thought-mesh"[7], a collective mind composed of countless component intelligences
                            distributed
                            across time and space. The mobile Vex machines encountered by Guardians are merely
                            containers
                            for these intelligences, which carry mind cores filled with milky radiolarian fluid -
                            hypothesized to be the only remnant of their distant biological origin.[8]
                            <br><br>
                            Vex come in a diverse array of shapes and sizes, but the majority share features such as
                            triangular or conical "heads," single glowing photoreceptors, jointed limbs, and in several
                            cases arrays of flexible tentacles. Despite their often animalistic appearance, the Vex
                            appear
                            to be mass-produced units, constructed of an unknown metal alloy resembling hammered
                            brass.[9]
                            Headshots on humanoid Vex do not do much damage and instead send them into a berserk state;
                            however, shooting the exposed mind cores in their abdomen will cause them to explode.[10]
                            The
                            Vex travel to the Floating Gardens to recycle their mechanical bodies when they are no
                            longer
                            functional.[11]

                        <p class="small-text"><span>Origins</span> <br>
                            The Vex originated in the "flower game" conducted between the Light and Darkness in the
                            primordial "garden" that existed prior to the creation of the universe. All of these games
                            would end with a single, self-sustaining pattern emerging and dominating the entire
                            simulation. This was pleasing to the Darkness, but was irritating to the Light, which
                            desired that the game produce endless novel patterns instead.

                            When the Light and Darkness began to war with one another, initiating the beginning of the
                            universe, the patterns from the flower game escaped into it. In the initial hot state of the
                            universe the abstract patterns existed as quantum fluctuations, before eventually creating a
                            more stable substrate for themselves in the briny seas of the first worlds to form in the
                            universe, the radiolaria. This was the origin of the Vex as they would later come to be
                            known, and from this point forward they were driven to once more totally dominate the
                            reality they found themselves in, though operating on "outdated" rules that did not account
                            for the paracausal powers of the Darkness or the Light.

                            <span>The Ancient Past</span><br>
                            The earliest historical event associated with the Vex is when the Hive god Crota, Son of
                            Oryx opened a portal to a place where the Vex were present, hoping to find a secret power
                            for himself. Instead, he allowed the Vex to invade Oryx, the Taken King's throne world, the
                            High War.[13] At first unsuited to the Ascendant Realm and the rules governing its reality,
                            the Vex quickly learned of the Hive's Sword-Logic, creating Quria, Blade Transform to
                            investigate it. Through Quria, the Vex learned to achieve divinity by killing all who
                            opposed them and adopting worship as a primary function. Though Oryx eventually succeeded in
                            eliminating the Vex from his realm, they preserved what they learned and passed it on to the
                            rest of the Vex hive mind.

                            worship and serve the Darkness. Their entire culture is based around a principle known as
                            The Sword Logic, which dictates that they must destroy other civilizations in order to
                            accrue paracausal power and feed the Worms that live within their bodies. Along with the
                            Darkness itself, they are led by a pantheon of dark gods, who derive power and sustenance
                            from the destruction wrought by the Hive.

                            In Sol, they have a significant presence on the Moon, where they have built the Hellmouth
                            and Scarlet Keep, as well as having a presence on certain regions of Earth,[1] around
                            Saturn, where the massive Dreadnaught orbits, the icy regions of Mars and on Titan, where

                            done in the process, crafting linked caverns and gothicesque columns; these underground
                            spaces resemble a dungeon recently pulled up after an extended period underwater.[3] They
                            are able to manipulate the physical world in ways humanity can only begin to imagine,[4] and
                            have witnessed the Darkness consume countless worlds in the past.[5]

                            The Hive are not an enemy military so much as rising force.[6] They base their entire
                            existence around the extermination of other forms of life, especially those that follow the
                            way of Light and the Traveler, and approach their task with religious fervor. To the Hive,
                            killing and conquest are not merely acts of war, but of worship.

                        <p class="small-text"><span>Origins</span> <br>
                            The Hive trace their origins to a gas giant named Fundament. Long ago, the proto-Hive
                            crashed their homeworld into Fundament, ostensibly to hide from something unknown. The
                            shards of this homeworld became a number of continents that floated upon a sea called the
                            Fundament Ocean within a layer of the gas giant's atmosphere, and the proto-Hive eventually
                            built a meager civilization upon them and forgot their old history. In addition to the
                            proto-Hive, Fundament was home to hundreds of other intelligent species, and Fundament's
                            fifty-two moons were inhabited by a space faring species called the Ammonites who were
                            overseen by the Traveler.[11][12][13]

                            Life was quick and harsh for the proto-Hive. Their natural lifespan rarely exceeded ten
                            Fundament-years, though females who ate "mother jelly" became able to spawn and live longer.
                            In terms of environmental hazards, Fundament was almost inhospitable. The Fundament Ocean
                            was toxic, the skies were eternally stormy, the rain poisonous and sometimes corrosive,
                            lightning had enough power to vaporize anyone it struck, "living clouds" called Stormjoys
                            would prey on the populace, and the proto-Hive frequently warred with each other.[11][10]

                            from the Darkness itself: Yul, the Honest Worm, Eir, the Keeper of Order, Xol, Will of the
                            Thousands, Ur, the Ever-Hunger, and Akka, the Worm of Secrets. The Worm Gods claimed that
                            they had lived and grown in Fundament's depths for millions of years, trapped by the
                            Leviathan and the Traveler. They had called many species to Fundament, hoping one would be
                            tenacious enough to find them. They offered Xi Ro, Sathona, and Aurash immortality if they
                            would allow themselves to be hosts for the Worms' larvae, with the caveat that if the
                            sisters ceased to obey their natures (Xi Ro's desire to test her strength, Sathona's
                            cunning, Aurash's inquisitiveness), their Worms would consume them. Furthermore, the
                            stronger the sisters became, the greater their Worms' appetites would be.[20]

                            using abandoned Cabal bases. They lack any type of established stronghold such as the

                            The Fallen's name for their own race is "Eliksni".[8] They were once graced by the Traveler,
                            which they named the "Great Machine", and were presumably uplifted by its gifts in the same
                            manner as humanity. Their ubiquitous cloaking technology was originally designed as toys for
                            children. The Eliksni made during their Golden Age twice the advancement in space
                            exploration than Humanity.[9] During this time, they came to control multiple star
                            systems[10] until a event known as the Edge Wars brought infighting among the Houses and
                            later ended by the House of Kings and House of Judgement to usher a Golden Age. Their
                            homeworld of Riis and civilization would be destroyed by a unforeseen event called the
                            "Whirlwind". In the aftermath, the surviving Fallen became embroiled in a bloody civil war
                            over their civilization's ruins, before achieving a tenuous peace and embarking on a journey
                            into space to locate the Traveler in order to return to greatness. The Fallen eventually
                            arrived at the Solar System shortly after humanity's Collapse, and rediscovered the Traveler
                            on Earth.[11]

                            <span>Early wars</span><br>
                            When the Fallen first arrived in the Sol System, they terrorized humanity, conducting raids
                            and attacks against outposts. Very early into these attacks, they started to meet opposition
                            in the form of Guardians, who fought back against them time and time again.[12] The Fallen
                            grew to resent the Guardians, seeing them as an obstacle that prevented them from claiming
                            the "Great Machine", and believed they were dooming them and their people.[1] Eventually,
                            the space below the Traveler turned into The City, as more and more people gathered below
                            the Traveler, and thus walls were built to defend them.[12] As time wore on, the Fallen
                            began to understand that if they wanted to take back what was theirs, they would need to do
                            it with force. This was the start of the Eliksni siege.

                            At some point during the Dark Age, the House of Rain encountered a human settlement
                            protected by Saint-14 on Mercury and proceeded to destroy the settlement and kill the
                            survivors, but were unable to kill Saint-14 who grew to hate the Fallen race after he
                            witnessed Dregs devouring children.

                            Rezyl Azzir began venturing out from the Last City to combat potential threats which earned
                            him great enmity from the Fallen. Eventually, a Captain of the House of Devils named Eksori
                            ambushed Rezyl in an attempt to kill him to gain glory, however Rezyl was easily able to
                            fend off the ambush. Later he teamed up with two other Guardians to kill a Kell whose Ketch
                            was stationed in the Tescan Valley between two mountain peaks.

                            heavy-set, rhinoceros-like appearance. Their ever expanding interstellar Cabal Empire
                            spreads through organization, efficiency, and corruption[5]. The Cabal army that occupied
                            Mars and held it for some time was but a fraction of their full might[6]. During the Red
                            War, Cabal warlord Dominus Ghaul and his Red Legion seized the Last City and the Traveler in
                            a surprise attack. After Ghaul's demise, the Red Legion shattered into numerous warring
                            factions across the Solar System. The exiled Emperor Calus, previously dethroned by Ghaul
                            and later arriving onboard his spaceship, the Leviathan, presents less antagonistic attitude
                            towards humanity and the Guardians. In recent time, Caiatl, daughter of Calus, assumed the
                            Imperial throne and became the new Empress of the Cabal Empire.</p>

                        <p class="small-text">The Cabal are an extremely tough species, willing to defend their
                            territory until every last
                            one of them is dead.[8] Their architecture is very industrial, with an emphasis on burrowing
                            into mountains for defense. They are a very industrious, militaristic species whose social
                            structure and way of life revolves largely around conquest and expansion.[9] Their armor and
                            technology can often be seen leaking a substance similar to oil and even emit smoke when
                            damaged or worn.[10] For centuries they have devoted their resources to occupying and mining
                            Mars,[11][12] contesting with the native Vex programming as evidenced by the many Cabal
                            ships seen bringing armies to and from the red planet, and recently dealing with the
                            Guardians.[8]

                            Interestingly, the Cabal is the only hostile race up to date that does not appear to overtly
                            feature worship in its culture—the Fallen worship their god-like Servitors, while Hive have
                            devoted their entire religion to the worship of the Darkness, while the Vex of the Sol
                            Divisive revere the unknown entity that is the Black Heart—but as of the Taken War, evidence
                            has been gathered that the Cabal revere a deity-like Emperor, later being revealed to be
                            Emperor Calus.[13][14] And at one point, they have even ruled the galaxy, and since the
                            reformations that happened within their empire, they seek to do it again, and likely
                            beyond.[15]

                            "In the Cabal legend, a hero seeks to possess the sun. He succeeds. Then, he becomes
                            Emperor. The Cabal... are not a subtle people."
                            — Tyra Karn[16]
                            According to Cabal myth, the first Emperor was a hero named Acrius who allegedly took the
                            sun.[16] In the earliest days of this new empire, the Cabal emperor ruled alongside the
                            venal military aristocracy known as the Praetorate, which allowed the people to suffer so
                            the Legions who served them could grow.[17]

                            Calus claims to have overseen a reign of glory. His Empire was an immense military power,
                            but valued willpower, learning, gentility, and subtlety. Debate was as celebrated as
                            warfare. Savage pit fights coexisted with precise marksmanship and refined martial arts. The
                            Empire crafted technological marvels[22] that allowed every need to be met and every life to
                            be lived in comfort.[23][24][25][26]

                            As the Cabal Empire expanded, it encountered countless alien races and absorbed them into
                            itself: indoctrinating their species, collecting their technology, learning their knowledge,
                            and merging with their culture. The number of species within the Cabal Empire "defied
                            reckoning,"[27] and examples of the things they created, whether texts, tech, or
                            superweapons, were archived in carefully maintained athenaeum worlds for study and potential
                            future use.[28][22]

                            Centuries after destroying the Psions' clairvoyant OXA Machine, word reached the emperor
                            that it had been rebuilt on the moon of Brand. The Evocate-General then sent her ships to
                            bomb the moon but Calus stopped her ships and instead proposed an alliance with Otzot, the
                            Psion which rebuilt the machine. [17]

                            It was seemingly during Calus's reign that the Cabal learned of the Traveler and the Light,
                            and gained some knowledge on the Darkness from the "Dreams of worms". His Empire has even
                            defeated a Light-empowered race on at least one occasion.

                        <p class="small-text">Like the Traveler, the Darkness is a cosmic paracausal force that has
                            existed since before the beginning of time. In our universe, it has been shown to enact its
                            will indirectly through numerous proxies and servants, with some of the most powerful being
                            worshiped as deities unto themselves. The Vex, Hive, Taken and Scorn are all linked to this
                            force.
                            <br><br>
                            The Darkness is fundamentally driven to reduce complexity and diversity within the universe,
                            and to eliminate any entity which cannot survive in the face of adversity; its philosophy is
                            tied to that of the Sword Logic, though not necessarily identical to it. The Darkness once
                            ruled the universe, and the Hive believe that the Light must be consumed for the Darkness to
                            reclaim its domination.[9] Its ultimate goal is to bring about an end-state of the universe
                            in which the only entities that exist are those that have overcome all possible obstacles to
                            their survival, and which have the strength to continue existing forever. It refers to this
                            goal as the "final shape" of the universe.

                            According to the Lore Book "Unveiling," which is seemingly narrated by the Darkness itself,
                            both the Light and the Darkness have existed since before the beginning of time, and thus
                            before the universe came into existence. Being unbound by the laws of causality, neither the
                            Light or Darkness can be said to have a beginning. Rather, they are emergent properties of
                            even more fundamental "mathematical structures" that in turn underlay reality itself. [10]

                            In the allegorical story recounted in the Lore Book, the Darkness and Light are referred to
                            as the "Winnower" and "Gardener" respectively. The Winnower and Gardener occupied themselves
                            by engaging one another in a game, analogous to a vastly more complex version of the "Game
                            of Life" devised by Earth mathematician John Conway. This game would consistently arrive at
                            an end-state dominated by a single, self-perpetuating pattern, which subsumed all others in
                            the game. The winnower found this to be a pleasing outcome, but the gardener felt the
                            pattern to be boring, and desired that the game endlessly produce novel patterns instead. In

                            The books describe the origin of the Hive on the gas giant Fundament, where three daughters
                            of a deposed king, Aurash, Xi Ro, and Sathona, set out to save their world from a prophesied
                            apocalypse, and in their quest encountered the massive being known as the Leviathan. The
                            Leviathan warned them against the temptation of "The Deep," a philosophy which held that
                            "existence is the struggle to exist," and which it claimed would lead them only to ruin and
                            calamity. It instead told them to pursue the philosophy of "The Sky," which encouraged
                            collaboration to build a kinder, more prosperous world, even if it meant that some deaths
                            and misfortunes must be allowed to occur. The sisters rejected the Leviathan's advice, and
                            dove deep into the core of their world to find the five Worms: Eir, the Keeper of Order, Ur,
                            the Ever-Hunger, Yul, the Honest Worm, Xol, Will of the Thousands, and Akka, the Worm of

                        <p class="small-text">The Red War was a major system-wide conflict fought between the Guardians of
                            the Last City, Cabal Red Legion, and other races of the Solar System. [2]
    
                            After years of fighting against the proxy forces of the Darkness and emerging victorious, the
                            Guardians found themselves outmatched when the Red Legion launched a surprise attack on the Last
                            City, destroying the Tower and sealing away the Traveler's Light. With their powers and arsenals
                            lost and their home conquered, the Guardians retreated to the outskirts of the European Dead
                            Zone to a place known as The Farm. There, the Guardians recovered and planned a counterattack in
                            order to save their home and legacy.
                            <br><br>
                            After much sacrifice and determination, the Guardians succeeded in liberating their home,
                            driving the Red Legion away, and awaken the Traveler from its centuries of slumber, restoring
                            their Light and destroying Ghaul forever. Despite this momentous victory, various figures of the
                            Red Legion would attempt to carry on the Red War, either for their own purposes or to finish
                            what Ghaul had started in destroying the Guardians. Despite these new foes, the Guardians
                            maintained their strength and determination, while also contending with major threats besides
                            the Red Legion.

                        <p class="small-text">During the Taken War, the Skyburners established a beachhead by ramming into
                            the hull of the Dreadnaught. Their primary objectives were to assume full control of the Hive
                            Dreadnaught, and find a way to "eat" a Guardian's Light, of which the Hive are infamously known
                            for. Unfortunately for the Cabal, the Taken and Hive decimated their forces, while the Guardians
                            compounded their losses by eliminating any remaining commanding officers that had been
                            stationed.
                            <br><br>
                            In light of the catastrophic losses to both the Guardians of the Last City and Oryx, the Taken
                            King, the remaining Cabal forces transmitted a detailed distress signal directed to the
                            incumbent head of the Cabal Empire, Dominus Ghaul, to inform him of their casualties and
                            findings.
                            <br><br>
                            Although the transmission was intercepted by the Guardians, it was nonetheless received by the
                            Cabal Empire, whom ultimately answered, leading to the beginning of the Red War between the Red
                            Legion and the Last City.

                        <p class="small-text"><span>Origins</span> <br>
                            According to the Lore Book "Unveiling," which is seemingly narrated by the Darkness itself,
                            both the Light and the Darkness have existed since before the beginning of time, and thus
                            before the universe came into existence. Being unbound by the laws of causality, neither the
                            Light or Darkness can be said to have a beginning. Rather, they are emergent properties of
                            even more fundamental "mathematical structures" that in turn underlay reality itself. [10]
    
                            In the allegorical story recounted in the Lore Book, the Darkness and Light are referred to
                            as the "Winnower" and "Gardener" respectively. The Winnower and Gardener occupied themselves
                            by engaging one another in a game, analogous to a vastly more complex version of the "Game
                            of Life" devised by Earth mathematician John Conway. This game would consistently arrive at
                            an end-state dominated by a single, self-perpetuating pattern, which subsumed all others in
                            the game. The winnower found this to be a pleasing outcome, but the gardener felt the
                            pattern to be boring, and desired that the game endlessly produce novel patterns instead. In

                            The earliest recorded mention of the Darkness known to the Guardians comes from the Books of
                            Sorrow, a collection of records discovered aboard the Dreadnaught of Oryx, the Taken King.
                            The books describe the origin of the Hive on the gas giant Fundament, where three daughters
                            of a deposed king, Aurash, Xi Ro, and Sathona, set out to save their world from a prophesied
                            apocalypse, and in their quest encountered the massive being known as the Leviathan. The
                            Leviathan warned them against the temptation of "The Deep," a philosophy which held that
                            "existence is the struggle to exist," and which it claimed would lead them only to ruin and
                            calamity. It instead told them to pursue the philosophy of "The Sky," which encouraged
                            collaboration to build a kinder, more prosperous world, even if it meant that some deaths
                            and misfortunes must be allowed to occur. The sisters rejected the Leviathan's advice, and
                            dove deep into the core of their world to find the five Worms: Eir, the Keeper of Order, Ur,
                            the Ever-Hunger, Yul, the Honest Worm, Xol, Will of the Thousands, and Akka, the Worm of
                            Secrets.
